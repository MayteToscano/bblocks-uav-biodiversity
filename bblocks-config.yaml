# A short, descriptive name of this building block collection
name: UBCP - UAV Biodiversity Capture Profile

abstract: |
  UBCP (UAV Biodiversity Capture Profile) is a modular set of OGC Building Blocks to model
  UAV biodiversity data capture requirements in an interoperable, machine-readable way.
  It defines a mandatory Core module and optional extensions (Thermal, Multispectral, LiDAR, RTK),
  plus an overall Profile building block that aggregates them.
